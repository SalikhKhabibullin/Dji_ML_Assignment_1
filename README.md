# Dji_ML_Assignment_1
I created 2 separate files for 2 tasks. Put ipynb-file to the folder, where are corresponding data_train and data_test.
I wrote helpful coomments but I guess you didn't like my python style of coding.
I think in this dataset there are no "powerful" features, which could built good model.

Classification:
    I created different models - to win the imbalance, dependent features.
Regression:
    I created different models - I used RMSE and R2 metrics. I tried to decrease Loss function.
